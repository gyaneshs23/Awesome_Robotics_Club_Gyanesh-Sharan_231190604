Why This Project?
I my research interest lies in the area of inverse kinematics and dynamics of a parallel manipulator and designing better control algorithms for its trajectory tracking. 
Since the task given in this project(Hexapod) aligns with my research interest so I found it as a great opportunity to learn a lot by doing this project to strengthen my research profile and skills in this area. 
Also this project will help me in better understanding of practical aspects of my research. So I chose this project
